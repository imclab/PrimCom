PrimCom
=======

PrimCom is a personal *knowledge base manager*, primarily made
for programmers. It is meant to be running in a terminal, thus
you can access and consult it quickly while working.

There are lots of code snippets that I use often but I
couldn't reproduce them easily from scratch. When I need
such a piece of code, either I look it up on my blog (if I
had written about it), or Google it. When I see the code, I
remember it and I can modify it to my needs. However, looking
up something on the Internet can take time (at least 30-60 seconds).

With PrimCom you can collect *your own code snippets* with *your
own examples*. You can assign tags to them and then easily find
them with the tags. PrimCom can perform two main actions: 
print the content of a file (to see an example), or open a 
web page.

PrimCom has several useful features too. It can copy the
content of a file to the clipboard; it has a built-in radio
player, etc. See the help for a detailed list.

Usage
-----

Open a terminal with *dark* background and launch it:

    $ ./h.py

Type `h` for help, `d` for the list of available tags.
