Nice summary: http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2012/7/24/Getting-Started-with-virtualenv-and-virtualenvwrapper-in-Python

Most useful commands:

* mkvirtualenv - used to create a new virtual environment. When you create a
                 new environment it automatically becomes the active environment.
* rmvirtualenv - used to remove an existing virtual environment. The environment
                 must be deactivated (see below) before it can be removed.
* mktmpenv     - it creates a temporary virtual environment, which is deleted as
                 soon as you deactivate it.
* workon       - used to activate a virtual environment. Will also list all existing
                 virtual environments if no argument is passed.
* deactivate   - used to deactivate the currently active virtual environment.
                 Note that workon will automatically deactivate the current
                 environment before activating a new one.
