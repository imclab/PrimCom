Nice summary: http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2012/7/24/Getting-Started-with-virtualenv-and-virtualenvwrapper-in-Python

Most useful commands:

* mkvirtualenv   - used to create a new virtual environment. When you create a
                   new environment it automatically becomes the active environment.
* rmvirtualenv   - used to remove an existing virtual environment. The environment
                   must be deactivated (see below) before it can be removed.
* mktmpenv       - it creates a temporary virtual environment, which is deleted as
                   soon as you deactivate it.
* workon         - used to activate a virtual environment. Will also list all existing
                   virtual environments if no argument is passed.
* deactivate     - used to deactivate the currently active virtual environment.
                   Note that workon will automatically deactivate the current
                   environment before activating a new one.
* mkproject      - Create a new virtualenv in the WORKON_HOME and
                   project directory in PROJECT_HOME.
* cdvirtualenv   - change the current working directory for the folder of venv
* cdsitepackages - change the current working directory to the site-packages for venv
* cdproject      - Change the current working directory to the folder of the
                   project that is associated to this venv.
                   Create the file $VENV/.project that contains the location
                   of the project folder.
* how to rename a virt. env.:
      cpvirtualenv oldenv newenv
      rmvirtualenv oldenv
