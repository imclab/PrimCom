# * By default, the pickled byte stream contains ASCII characters only.
# * The pickle format is specific to Python.
# * Never unpickle data received from an untrusted or unauthenticated source.
# * Only the data for the instance is pickled, not the class definition, thus
#     when you want to unpickle instances of a class, donâ€™t forget to import 
#     the definition of this class!
