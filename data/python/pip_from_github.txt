requests on GitHub is here:
    https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests

here is how to install it via pip from GitHub:
    sudo pip install -U https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/zipball/master

another way (it worked better for me than the previous one):
    sample repo: https://github.com/morninj/django-email-obfuscator
    command: pip install -e git+https://github.com/morninj/django-email-obfuscator.git#egg=django-email-obfuscator

(1) pip freeze > requirements.txt
(2) pip install -r requirements.txt
