add(elem)
    Add element elem to the set.
remove(elem)
    Remove element elem from the set. Raises KeyError if elem is not contained in the set.
discard(elem)
    Remove element elem from the set if it is present.
pop()
    Remove and return an arbitrary element from the set. Raises KeyError if the set is empty.
clear()
    Remove all elements from the set.

isdisjoint(other)
    Return True if the set has no elements in common with other. Sets are disjoint if and only if their intersection is the empty set.
    New in version 2.6.
issubset(other)
set <= other
    Test whether every element in the set is in other.
set < other
    Test whether the set is a proper subset of other, that is, set <= other and set != other.
issuperset(other)
set >= other
    Test whether every element in other is in the set.
set > other
    Test whether the set is a proper superset of other, that is, set >= other and set != other.
union(other, ...)
    Return a new set with elements from the set and all others.
    Changed in version 2.6: Accepts multiple input iterables.
intersection(other, ...)
    Return a new set with elements common to the set and all others.
    Changed in version 2.6: Accepts multiple input iterables.
difference(other, ...)
    Return a new set with elements in the set that are not in the others.
    Changed in version 2.6: Accepts multiple input iterables.
symmetric_difference(other)
    Return a new set with elements in either the set or other but not both.
