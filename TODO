* lines are numbered, so add support to manipulate them:

l2.sh       -> take line 2 and execute it in the shell (with bash)
               if the line starts with "$ ", remove it intelligently
l2.py       -> take line 2 and execute it with the Python 2 interpreter
l2.py3      -> take line 2 and execute it with the Python 3 interpreter
l4.cb       -> take line 4 and copy it to the clipboard
l2,4-7.cb   -> take lines 2,4,5,6,7 and copy them to the clipboard
