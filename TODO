* lines are numbered, so add support to manipulate them:

l2.py       -> take line 2 and execute it with the Python 2 interpreter
l2.py3      -> take line 2 and execute it with the Python 3 interpreter

* show() creates a temp. file in /tmp . Put these filenames in a queue,
  and upon exit remove all these files if they still exist (called from
  atexit). That is, clean up and leave no trash.
